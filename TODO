=================
General

- Set up Defaults in the debian/control file.
  [DMA 20080807 - ?]

- Use ($$) arg templates in all functions
  [DMA 20080827 - ?]

- Use argument fault checks all exported functions
  [DMA 20080827 - ?]

=================
Notes.pm

- test the code. I have not ever run it, this is only a skeleton so I 
  remember the ideas.
  [DMA 20040927-?]

- there is so much similarility with LogFile, I wonder if
  we need another abstract superclass?
  [DMA 20040927-?]

=================
PageIterator and PageId

- IN GENERAL THE USE OF side and pagealpha is confusing nomenclature
  and should be simplified. Also, since other entities are page and 
  subpage, it should perhaps be pagealpha.
  [DMA 20060705 - ?]

- ARCHIVIST: setting page to 000b.1 does not work, it
  stays with the sequence already in place. To implement I
  would have to fit it into the following. The matches are
  order dependendant so it would have to be done at the
  right location. Also, the change would affect SWITCH code 
  in other locations in PageIterator and PageId.
	sub parse {
	  my ($class, $lexeme, $flg) = @_;
	  my (@vals) = ("", $lexeme,);
	  defined $flg || ($flg = 0);
	  my $delim        = ($flg) ? "p" : "";
	  my ($lpar,$rpar) =  ($lexeme =~ /^($delim)(.*)/);
	  defined $lpar   || ($lpar = "");
	  $lpar eq $delim || (return @vals);
	 SWITCH: {$_ = $rpar;
	    # Example:	001.04b
	    if (/^(\d+\.\d+[a-z])(.*)/) { @vals = ($1,$2); last SWITCH;}
		    # Example:	001.04
	    if (/^(\d+\.\d+)(.*)/)	 { @vals = ($1,$2); last SWITCH;}
		    # Example:	000.spine
	    if (/^(0+.spine)(.*)/)	 { @vals = ($1,$2); last SWITCH;}
		    # Example:	000a
	    if (/^(\d+[a-z])(.*)/)	 { @vals = ($1,$2); last SWITCH;}
		    # Example:	001
	    if (/^(\d+)(.*)/)		 { @vals = ($1,$2); last SWITCH;}
	  }
	  return @vals;
	}

	- BUG: ScanBooklet cannot handle page number like '001a.1' but
	  does not say so. Instead it gives you a name like '001a-001b'
	  I can't see how it manages to switch to double page mode.
	  [DMA 20070514-?]

- ARCHIVIST: need support for atop,abot, etc
  [DMA 20070514-?]

=================
TocFile

- ARCHIVIST: bug in Document::TocFile->open
  With this file name
  20070503-20070506-Debian-bplay-0.991-Sources-annotatedDMA
  it fails to create the .toc file. Creation of the .log
  succeeded; it also succeeds with names like
  20070503-foo.pm-Sources-annotatedDMA
  [DMA 20070506 - ?]

- Toc and log should include the md5sum of the added page.
  [DMA 20080828-?]

- I need to confirm the arg to _setdirobj is a good path and is
  writeable to us.
  [DMA 20040902 - ?]

- I added a local _err method as it was undefined. It does exist in 
  File::Spec:BaseParse, but this is not a subclass of it. That call
  saves the last error message in 'fmt_err' or something like that
  but does not print. What to do here may become more apparent when
  I work my way back to the GUI level with the GTK code.
  [DMA 20040902 - ?]

- SCANBOOKLET: if you use ScanBooklet with a doc name with 
  "--" the .toc creation fails. Extra dash is removed from
  the internal file names
   Failed to open temp file 
           ARCHIVE///20051012-MysqlSetupExample-annotatedDMA/.toc.tmp! 
           No such file or directory
  [DMA 20070514-?]

- BUG: Incorrect date causes file failure
	  ./ScanBooklet 1990900 AOPAPilot /dma/Publications/AOPAPilot
	   Failed to open temp file
	   /dma/Publications/AOPAPilot//20990900-AOPAPilot/.toc.tmp!

=================
Toc

- Add and remove could invalidate the current mark. We should
  check this in _lazy, and be sure to execute it before
  returning any mark values, page,title,pages,titles...
  all should require _lazy eval
  [DMA20040912 - ?]

- initmark in parent does a lazy eval. Think about an override.
  [DMA20040912 - ?]


=================
LogFile

- new. Do I have to detect if the directory is in an archived state?
  [DMA 20040829 - ?]

- new. What if there is a .log of the wrong type?
  [DMA 20040829 - ?]

- Logfile class seems related to the Fault::Notes and Fault::Log types.
  Can use those clases at all to simplify the Document classes?
  [DMA 20080828-?]

- Toc and log should include the md5sum of the added page.
  [DMA 20080828-?]

=================
Members

- _selmembers. Make it like _selpage. Add the external call here 
  and override in Toc Class
  [DMA20040830 - ?]

=================
PublicationPage

- method fulltitle: This is just an alias name for some legacy code 
  and can go away when I update it.
  [DMA 20040830 - ?]

- I could add some toc and log info facts to the info method output.
  [DMA 20080828-?]

=================
Directory

- Are PageTitles are really more like PageKeys, search keys for the page?
  Or did I actually set up tocs for full titles of each article contained by
  the page? I may have...
  [DMA 20080828-?]

- Methods to consider adding
	- display the toc
	- search the log
	- add notes
	- edit the toc, filenames, etc
